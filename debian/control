Description: DNS configuration Anonymity Linux Distribution Workstations
 Whether a Anonymity Linux Distribution Gateway supports anonymized system DNS
 for Workstation's traffic (also known as Transparent DNS Proxy) mainly depends
 on the Gateway's firewall.
 .
 This package is simply installing /etc/resolv.conf which points to
 10.152.152.10, where an Anon-Gateway is supposed to provide a DnsPort on port
 53.
 .
 When you do not wish to use the Transparent DNS features, this package can be
 removed.
